Web-application to facilitate the use of the New-Delhi (Inida) Metro System [Timathon Submission]

This is a web application developed to allow users to find the best metro (subway) route for their daily or special commute. The Delhi-Metro system is remarkable, however; it is rather complex to understand and navigate through. The application makes the process MUCH easier by providing the best route based on start and end location. The route is found using an algorithm built upon Breadth-First-Search. 

The application was built using React and does not have a server or backend side. It also makes use of ReactScroll for smooth scrolling throughout the application, Font-Awesome for icons, unDraw for grpahics (SVGs) and Pexels Video for video element. 

Soon to be hosted on Netlify

to try the application, simply clone the repository or download the code, in the main folder, run the command 'npm install'. This will install all dependecies. Once complete, run the command 'npm start; and it will start the React Server on localhost:3000.
